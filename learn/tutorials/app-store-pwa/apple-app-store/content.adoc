This tutorial shows how you build and submit your progressive web application (https://vaadin.com/pwa[PWA^]) to the Apple App Store. We use the PWA from our https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/modern-web-apps-with-spring-boot-and-vaadin[Modern Web App] tutorial series and create an Xcode project from it using the PWA Builder. You can find more details about the PWA Builder in their https://github.com/pwa-builder[GitHub repository^].

TIP: You can also use the PWA Builder to turn your existing web app into a PWA.

NOTE: Every PWA submitted to the Apple App Store must pass their review process before it is published in the store


== PREREQUISITES

=== Software

* An OSX development device with Xcode installed.

TIP: You can rent a cloud Mac from services like https://www.macincloud.com/[macincloud.com^], if you don't have access to an Apple computer.

=== Apple accounts

* Sign up for, or log in to, an https://www.icloud.com/[iCloud account^].
* Sign up for the https://developer.apple.com/[Apple Developer program^].

NOTE: There is an annual fee of $99 for the Apple Developer program.

=== A PWA

A PWA
We’ll be using the PWA Builder to package a PWA for submission to the Apple App Store. The PWA Builder can be used to transform existing websites into PWAs and also to package them for app store submission.

If you don't have a PWA, we recommend getting started with Vaadin. Our https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/modern-web-apps-with-spring-boot-and-vaadin[comprehensive tutorial series^], and https://vaadin.com/docs/index.html[technical documentation^] make it easy to build your first PWA!

Alternatively, follow one of our https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/learn-pwa[framework-independent basic tutorials^] to turn your existing web app into a PWA.

== Run PWA Builder

=== Option 1: Use the PWA Builder online

. Go to https://www.pwabuilder.com/ and enter the URL of your PWA:

=== Option 2: Use The PWA Builder CLI

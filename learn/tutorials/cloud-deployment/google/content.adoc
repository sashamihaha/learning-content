This tutorial shows you how to deploy a Java web application to Google Cloud. Google Cloud offers a 90-day free trial that includes $300 of credits to spend and an unlimited ‘Always Free’ tier. You can find details of their free and commercial services on their link:https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier[documentation page].

NOTE: You need a credit card to confirm your identity when signing up on Google Cloud. 

We use the latest Vaadin link:https://vaadin.com/start/latest[Spring Boot starter app] in our example. You can see the example app running on Google Cloud link:https://vaadin-demo-test.ew.r.appspot.com/[here].

The tutorial includes two options to deploy the application: 

. As a JAR file directly from your command line. 

. As a Docker container from a GitHub repository using Google’s Kubernetes Engine.

NOTE: We recommend deploying Vaadin in Docker containers running on VM instances on the GCP. While GCP offers the Cloud Run and App Engine standard services for quick deployments, these are not suitable for V14 applications.

== Prerequisites:

* Create a Google Cloud account at https://cloud.google.com/.
* Verify that you have Java installed by running the `java --version` command in your terminal. If not, link:https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/[download] and install the latest version on your computer.
* Verify that you have Git installed by running the `git --version` command in your terminal. If not, link:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[download] and install the latest version on your computer.
* Verify that you have Maven (at least version 3.0) installed by running the `mvn -v` command in your terminal. If not, link:https://maven.apache.org/[download] and install the latest version on your computer.

== Option 1: From Command Line

=== Set up Google Cloud

. Sign into your Google Cloud account: https://console.cloud.google.com/.

. Install Google SDK. You can find detailed instructions on how to install on different platforms on the lnk:https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs[SDK documentation page].

. Create a new project at https://console.cloud.google.com/ and provide a name for it:
+
image::dashboard-new-project.png[New project in dashboard.]
+
. Go to *COMPUTE > App Engine > Dashboard* in the navigation menu on the left:
+
image::app-engine-menu.png[Compute APP ENGINE.]
+
. Click *Create Application*.
+
image::app-engine-create.png[Create APP ENGINE application.]
+
. Choose your region and then select *Create app*.
+
TIP: You can learn more about choosing a region in the link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones#choosing_a_region_and_zone[Google Cloud documentation].
+
image::region-select-menu.png[Choose region.]
+
. Select:
* *Language: Java*
* *Environment: Flexible* 

=== Prepare the application

. Download and open a starter project from http://vaadin.com/start/latest. Select *Spring Boot* as the technology stack and fill the *Maven Group ID* and *Project Name* as you see fit (or leave them at the defaults).
. Change the server port in your Spring project `application.properties` file in src/main/resources to: `server.port=${port:8080}`. You can find more details about this in the link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto-change-the-location-of-external-properties[Spring documentation]
. Generate a *JAR* file (``.jar`) of your application using the `mvn package -Pproduction` command.

=== Configure Google SDK

Initialize Google SDK with the gcloud init command as follows:

----
Welcome! This command will take you through the configuration of gcloud.

Settings from your current configuration [default] are:
compute:
  region: europe-west4
  zone: europe-west4-a
core:
  account: youremail@yourcompany.com
  disable_usage_reporting: 'False'
  project: vaadin-demo-test

Pick configuration to use:
 [1] Re-initialize this configuration [default] with new settings 
 [2] Create a new configuration
Please enter your numeric choice: 
----
If the current configuration is correct, press 1 to continue.
To create a new configuration, press 2. We create a new configuration to show the steps:

* Enter a name

* Choose your account or login with a new account:
----
Choose the account you would like to use to perform operations for 
this configuration:
 [1] youremail@yourcompany.com
 [2] Log in with a new account
Please enter your numeric choice:  1
----
* Select 1. to use your current account and project. 
----
You are logged in as: [youremail@yourcompany.com].

Pick cloud project to use: 
 [1] project name 1
 [2] project name 2
 [3] project name 3
Please enter numeric choice or text value (must exactly match list 
item):  1
----
* Select the number corresponding to the project you created previously. 
----
Your Google Cloud SDK is configured and ready to use!
----
* SDK is now configured for deployment.

=== Deploy your application

. Navigate to the folder containing the generated *JAR* (``.jar`) file (usually  `/target`) and open a new terminal.

. Use the `gcloud app deploy YOUR_APP_NAME.jar` command to deploy the application. 
+
NOTE: Replace `YOUR_APP_NAME` with the name of your generated JAR file
+
. Verify the details and confirm by entering Y.
